Single Tag/ Bachelor Tag
........................
In HTML, there are two types of tags - single tags and paired tags.

A single tag is an HTML tag that doesn't require a closing tag. It is also called a self-closing tag or void element. 
Single tags are used to define elements that do not have any content. 
Some examples of single tags in HTML are the <br>, <img>, and <input> tags.

A paired tag, on the other hand, is an HTML tag that has an opening and a closing tag. 
The opening tag defines the start of the element, and the closing tag defines the end of the element. 
Content can be added between the opening and closing tags. Some examples of paired tags in HTML are the <p>, <div>, and <a> tags.
