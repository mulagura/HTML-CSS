Here is a list of popular browsers and their corresponding CSS prefixes for cross-compatibility:

1. Mozilla Firefox (Gecko engine): 
   - Prefix: `-moz-`

2. Google Chrome (Blink engine):
   - Prefix: `-webkit-`

3. Safari (Blink engine):
   - Prefix: `-webkit-`

4. Microsoft Edge (Chromium engine):
   - Prefix: `-webkit-` (for backward compatibility) and `-ms-`

5. Opera (Blink engine):
   - Prefix: `-webkit-` 

It's important to note that CSS prefixes are used to provide experimental 
or non-standard CSS features that are not yet fully supported by all browsers. 
However, with the advancements in browser technology, the need for using prefixes has decreased significantly. 
It is generally recommended to use vendor prefixes sparingly and check for standard CSS support across browsers.
