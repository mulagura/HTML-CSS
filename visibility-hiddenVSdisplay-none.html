        <!-- display:none; ==> will not appear in page and no space allocated but can interact through DOM;
                               removes the element from the normal flow of the page;  
                             The value none lets you turn off the display of an element; 
                             when you use none, all descendant elements also have their display turned off.
            visibility:hidden; ==> will not appear in page but space is allocated and will present in DOM 
                             maintains the box model of the element   
            opacity:0 ==>     will not appear but if a href is given still you can click on        
            *ngIf ==> removes elemnt from DOM tree itself if it found to be true; 
             detaches it from DOM events, detaches the component from Angular change detection, and destroys it                                                                        -->
